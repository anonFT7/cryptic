# Cryptic

An open-source open-world multiplayer hacking game.

## What is it?!

Cryptic is an deep strategy game.
You start with only one virtual computer ingame and a few crypto coins.
The goal of cryptic is to hack other players and think creative like real hackers.
You must think hard about your actions before attacking another player and learn the basics of the game.
But all in all it's not so hard to start!

## I want to play!

Nothing easier than that! Three steps to start:
### 1. Choose a client

Cryptic supports many clients to play.
The most popular is the client for your browser: [click here](https://play.cryptic-game.net/)
But you can also play in an virtual terminal: [cryptic-term](https://github.com/cryptic-game/cryptic-term)

More clients are everywhere in the internet, so it's your choice.

If you want you can develop your own bot or actually a client.

### 2. Choose a server

The main server is hosted on https://api.cryptic-game.net/, but you can [host your own](https://github.com/cryptic-game/server) for family and friends.

### 3. Have FUN!

At the end you have to create an account. After that you can become the strongest hacker of cryptic.

## I want to help!

No matter what skills you have... ALL ARE HELPFUL!
From design to development. For more information talk to us on discord or write us an email.

### Development quickstart
As we are a small project every help is appreciated and we need you.
To allow you to help easily we created a quickstart script, that 
downloads all microservices and automatically installs all their dependencies.
You can run the script by running
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cryptic-game/cryptic/blob/master/quickstart.sh | bash
```
in your favorite command line.
It will also try to install system wide dependencies the setup script needs. At the moment only
Debian based systems (or more accurately systems that use the Advanced Packaging Tool (apt))
are supported. If you would like to implement the same thing for Arch Linux for example, 
your help is very much appreciated.

## Organisation

Behind cryptic exists a not profit-oriented team.
That team maintains the game, adds new features and publishes new versions.
You can become apart of it by contributing to cryptic.
